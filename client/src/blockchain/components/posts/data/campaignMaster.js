		description: 'We are a group of artists, sculptors, and dreamers who aspire to have an art-gallery for these artists to exhibit their talents, inspire others in and around Santa Monica centered around Santa Monica Community College.  We intend to have a physical location in a convenient place for an art gallery, enable safe-and-pleasant experience for various audiences. We also intend to post our gallery on the web. The proceedings of the Art work sold, original or digital, will be distributed among work and art contributors, share art with our financial contributors including tickets based on contribution amount. This is a co-op and all decisions are made via consensus of equivalency vote. All financial and major decisions would be transparent to all contributors.',
		intension: 'This idea sparked in a conversation among few student artists who has some artwork but has no place to share with others. Upon survey in the school, it turned out that there are many such part time artists, who go to school and part time job, have no opportunity to have an artistic aspiration. This, if successful, will not only enable current students and young artists from the local community, but we structured the governance in such a way that it can be transferred to younger students as older students pass out and move into their lives. We believe that this will have a transformative effect.', // How will it be good for the world

		summary: 'Most of us lack opportunities beyond becoming state-sponsored, augmented by hard work, to be a part of the workforce. With your help, many of us will dare to dream in life. May be, if we are successful, many such endeavors will prop up across the state or country beyond just arts but in other faculties too. In line with Dylan’s song, “If we are not busy being born, we are busy dying”, we could rewrite that to, “If young minds are not creative, then they are destructive.” Help us to excavate human potentials, offer opportunities where there are none, and pave way for an enhanced celebration of life for many.',
