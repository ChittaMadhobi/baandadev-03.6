												<b>Background Story</b>: You are viewing Baanda through the eyes of a young man named Angelo Michael. He is studying programming in a community college, and has been looking for a part time job that works around his school schedule. He is also passionate about art, and is trying to create an art-gallery co-operative with other aspiring young men and women. He wants to live with like-minded people, and share resources (pool-shared economy) instead of barely living to make ends meet. His co-op is also crowdfunding and propagating their art-gallery news via emulated word-of-mouth (gossip or ripple) process. Soon, they want to sell their artwork by Baanda catalog system (coming soon in next release). This UX is Baanda helping Angelo with all of these dimensions of his life.

											Presently, the Baanda team is working with shoestring budget and has only a one-man tech-team; time and finances are stretched very thin. The UX is designed in compartments, like Lego-pieces, such that it can be easily transformed into backwards facing traditional devices (mobile-first), as well as for immersive holographic experience on next-gen browsers (e.g. Argon etc.), or other augmented reality (AR) devices, like HoloLens).

												<b>Technology and Architecture</b>: The technology base is via MERNE (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs, Ethereum), graphs-charts via Fusioncharts, uses cloud-based API as GoogleMap, NLP engine as DialogFlow. The cloud vendors used are Heroku on AWS, MLab (for database) and Rinkby testnet of Ethereum. Microservices is and will be in distributed servers (Express/Pivotal/AWS etc.), like lego-pieces, scalable on demand, zero downtime, and use any language that is appropriate for the cause. Baanda (R&D) is dabbling with Argon for holographic interface and holoLens for VR interface but waiting for more generalize conduits since they need iOS and MS-windows respectively. IoT sensors are now limited to camera but intends to partner with IoT vendors as funds become available. When funded, it will be a combination of Web-App, DApp, & Holo-App. The immersive experience is not conceived for vision & sound only but immersed direct interaction with the world around via IoT sensors and acutator. Present security is standard now but Baanda architecture envisions biometric-security, attached to global lifetime Baanda ID, with scrambled data to keep Baanda (mathematical) promise that individual's data will not be used for marketing, government, or mind-manipulation in any way.
