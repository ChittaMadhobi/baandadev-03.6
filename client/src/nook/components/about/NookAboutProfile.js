          be able to assist you.<p> </p>
          
          <p>Preferred Name: Your preferred name is how you want Baanda to address you. For example, your name
          is Jeffrey, but everyone calls you 'The Dude' and you like that nickname too. Baanda
          will call you whatever you like.</p>
          <p>Preferred Pronoun: Your preferred pronoun is the gender you identify yourself with. You can also
          say, 'Just my name, please.'</p>
          <p>Age you Feel: The age you feel is not necessarily your chronological age. The numbers and
          descriptions are guidelines. Don't overthink it. You can change it anytime.</p>
          <p>How you feel Physically and Mentally: Your physical and mental attributes are ballpark answers. It simply gives Baanda
          a general sense of who you are today. You can always change your answer later if you want. 
          Baanda knows that human beings may change how they feel about themselves from one day 
          to the next, or one minute to the next in some cases.</p>
          <p>Share a snippet of your life: You can write anything. What makes you special? 
          What makes you tick? What did you do last night? What do you like to think about? 
          Remember, it's just you and Baanda here. Baanda is AI and doesn't judge.</p>

          your answers because Baanda will not make snap judgements about you based on 
          them. It is more of a starting point and as time goes on, Baanda will know you
          based on other methods such as causal inference.

          Baanda is like that friend who introduces you to someone new and says you guys 
          have so much in common. At Baanda, we use a term called "mining talent". We
          believe that everyone has talent and sometimes we don't even realize that the
          thing that we're good at naturally can have a greater purpose. Baanda's goal is
          to bring those talents to light.
