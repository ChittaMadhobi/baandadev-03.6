          to store for your eyes only. These tools integrate into all the Baanda 
          modules and Baanda AI uses them to learn about you. Particularly in the 
          diary, if you are constantly writing about something, Baanda will know that
          it is an important issue in your life at this time.

          and you can search for them. Indirectly, Baanda AI will learn about your
          priorities and your emotional state at that time. It will learn if you 
          procrastinate, it will learn if you like to keep busy, it will learn about
          your long-term goals, etc. Eventually, the system will be able to help you
          accomplish your tasks and goals more efficiently. The system will eventually 
          be able to find opportunities or connections for you based on your interests,
          needs, goals, etc.
